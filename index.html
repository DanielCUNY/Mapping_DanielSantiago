<p>When Julian Klein was growing up in Ocean Township, N.J., as a member of a
family that attended synagogue on a regular basis, questions about his identity
were constant.</p>

<p>Klein, a 31-year-old transgender man who uses he/him pronouns, said he has had
to “come out” twice in his life: First, at 17 years old, as a female-identifying
person attracted to women, and then, at 22 years old, as a trans man.</p>

<p>For Klein, who grew up attending classes three days a week at his local
synagogue, the initial reaction from his religious family was "a very negative
experience."</p>
<p>The notion that one could purge "sinful thoughts" through intense religious
exercise was never far from Klein's mind.</p>


<p>"You try to 'conversion therapy' yourself," Klein said, as he recollected memories
of feeling “guilty, broken and wrong” while being part of a religion that
“ostracized and demonized” people like him.</p>


<p>Conversion therapy — any attempt to change a person's sexual orientation,
gender identity or gender expression — was already on the radar of advocates
who wanted to protect LGBTQ youths by the time Klein came out in 2013.
California enacted the first law to protect residents from the practice in 2012, and
since then, 18 other states and more than 100 local governments around the
country have taken similar measures.</p>
<p>But nearly a decade later, the practice persists thanks to loopholes that allow
religious groups to continue conversion therapy and a belief among some
therapists that the issue has become politicized.</p>

<p>To many advocates, the practice still represents a threat in the life of many
Americans who battle with gender identity and sexual orientation issues —
especially LGBTQ youth.</p>

<p>“Family acceptance is what we should strive for moving forward. We want
LGBTQ kids to grow with their families and stay together,” said Mathew
Shurka, co-founder of "Born Perfect," a program dedicated to ending the practice
through legislation and litigation.</p>

<p>“We want parents to love their kids, we want political leaders and religious
leaders to embrace that, but it is all being jeopardized by anti-trans bills.”</p>

<p>Nearly 700,000 LGBTQ adults in the United States have received or experienced
conversion therapy, and 350,000 of them received it as adolescents, according to
The Williams Institute School of Law at UCLA.</p>

<p>That number could continue to grow.</p>

<p>Last year, a federal appeals court, with a district that encompasses Alabama,
Georgia and Florida, issued a ruling based on First Amendment grounds that
barred an injunction against conversion therapy.</p>

<p>"People have intense moral, religious, and spiritual views about these matters —
on all sides. And that is exactly why the First Amendment does not allow
communities to determine how their neighbors may be counseled about matters
of sexual orientation or gender," the majority of Eleventh Circuit Court judges
wrote in the decision.</p>

<p>More than 10% of the LGBTQ population lives in states in with a preliminary
injunction currently preventing enforcement of laws protecting residents from
conversion therapy, according to the Movement Advancement Project, with at
least five federal lawsuits challenging the laws.</p>

<p>As always, geography is a defining factor in the fight: A federal judge in
Washington state recently rejected an attempt by a family counselor to block the
state's law prohibiting conversion therapy on minors.</p>

<p>"The biggest issue is not only that conversion therapy is not banned completely,
but the large increase of prevention bills popping up all over the country," Shurka
said.</p>

<p>"Some of these bills aim to make it impossible to ban conversion therapy in some
states," he said.</p>

<p>Christopher Doyle, a licensed psychotherapist and executive director of the
Institute for Healthy Families, a nonprofit Judeo-Christian therapeutic
organization in Manassas, Virginia, says he does not support a ban on the
therapeutic method.</p>

<p>If the case involves a minor, Doyle says that through his work, he "deals with
families and children to improve their relationship and reduce chances of harm"
and that "it is up to every therapist to balance out their approaches to serve their
patients better and uphold the 'do no harm' principles."</p>

<p>“There is great hypocrisy,” Doyle says of activists that support a conversion
therapy ban. He believes “the issue is about a political agenda for them based on
their political motivation.”</p>

<p>Harm is the prevailing concern for LGBTQ advocates. A global study from the UN
Human Rights Council that included responses from 8,000 people across 100
countries showed 98% of people who have undergone conversion therapy suffered
damage that included suicidal thoughts, physical harm, depression, anxiety, shame,
self-hatred and loss of faith.</p>

<p>The responsibility to provide safety and security often falls in the hands of public
officials who can enact the laws most LGBTQ people still need, said James Guay,
a survivor of conversion therapy who now works as a marriage and family
therapist in California. And while a nationwide ban is still not a reality, advocates
think that continuous pressure will get the message across to the government.</p>

<p>“Making it illegal for anyone to profit off of harming others is part of the role of
governments in terms of protecting its citizens from harm, malpractice, and
abuse,” Guay said.</p>
